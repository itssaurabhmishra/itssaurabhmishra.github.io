## The start of a lifelong endeavour

This blog has been brought into existence from the realm of thoughts, for the manifestation process of all concepts and ideas that I have been lazy enough to not write down before this day. I promise to update this space regularly with all ideas, concepts and theories that wander in my mindspace through the day, so as to create a repository that can facilitate me in my lifelong endeavour of learning and research.

Objectively,
Saurabh Mishra
