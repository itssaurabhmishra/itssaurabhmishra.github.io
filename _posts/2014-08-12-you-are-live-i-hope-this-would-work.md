## A New Post

Hi, saurabh this is your new blog where you can start working on things, see
i have created this thing now you can use prose.io and log in with your github account and start producing content right away without getting involved with the github.

See its very simple go to prose.io log in using GITHUB and then you would land upon something unusual and then ask me where to go, 

I think you know better then me.

Go fire up the world.

PS 
Pending work such domain name redirect, 
and some more code cleanups are required !
